# Football Bingo
WHOOP, or Football Bingo, will be a mobile application hosted via 12thmanlive.com allowing football fans the opportunity to engage with each other and the game in real-time. Every player will have one free bingo card for a sports game, the card will contain carefully selected 'chips' defining a particular condition that, if true about the respective game, will be awarded to the player. Some such chips, when awarded, will be 'instant winners' giving the player immediate rewards, but the goal of this application is to keep users engaged in the sports game as they attempt to achieve a bingo! Which will reward a small selection of winners with larger prizes.
Stakeholders include fans, sponsors, and the TAMU Athletics department. The goal of this application is to increase TAMU sports fans' exposure to 12thmanlive.com, encourage camaraderie amongst fans, and as a method of understanding more about the sports fan base through registration rates, feedback, etc.
